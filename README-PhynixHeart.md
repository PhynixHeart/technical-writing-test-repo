# The Lesbian Agenda
This project is primary a secret project in order to over throw and destroy the patriarchy as well as similar establishments that hold back women in our daily lives.
Similar to the Gay Agenda TM by name only, the Lesbian Agenda differs greatly!

## Visuals and Examples
There are millions of examples ( in fact about 390 million examples or related examples. ) Some of the best examples related to The Lesbian Agenda are: 
Mary Lambert [Project example](https://youtu.be/nsc01-0V_QU)
Hayley Kiyoko [Project example](https://youtu.be/I0MT8SwNa_U)
Many other examples apply to The Lesbian Agenda

## Installation
Installing The Lesbian Agenda is easy! In fact today with those that are in power, it's easier then ever before!

[ ] 1 - Start by preparation of your physical appearance. Nails must be trimmed to a minimum or a balance between available nail polish real estate and smooth comfort. Hair should be either short ( particularly at the sides ) or extremely long but dyed in exotic or bright colors. Clothing should be rough and crude or extra feminine.

[ ] 2 - Secondly if you are partnered with a man, a dumping is required. If you are un-partnered then you are ready for the next step!

[ ] 3 - Find another woman or queer person. Expect this step to take as long as many days or as little as a couple hours. Chat, flirt, complement, or vigorously make out in front of a building or symbol of the patriarchy.

[ ] 4 - Scheduled a uHaul truck ( something at least big enough for 75% to 90% of everything you own. ) Then move in to the living arrangement that is appropriately comfortable to the corresponding woman or queer person of choice.
This should conclude the installation of The Lesbian Agenda. If there was any issues or problems, stop everything and repeat from step 1.

## Usage Availability
The Lesbian Agenda can be followed in every single aspect of a girl's life. From the moment she wakes up, to when she makes morning tea, at work, taking care of children, playing video games, or even activities done just before bed. The availability, practicality, and functions of The Lesbian Agenda are limitless!
